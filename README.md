# Arikene

Arikene is a text based game desined for terminal use. This is my first project with Python.

It is currently only a Beta and is only intended for playtesting at this moment. You must have Python3.x installed for it to run, it is also intended to be ran from a terminal window.

For windows, this means you need to open CMD, and type "python arikene.py" or "python3 arikene.py".

If you're using linux, then you already know what to do. But copy what MacOS and Windows does in case you don't. ;)

If you're using MacOS, open your terminal, and type "python arikene.py".
